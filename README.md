## 🌍 Air Quality Trends Across Major Indian Cities (2015–2024)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes air quality trends across major Indian cities from 2015 to 2024. Using Python, the analysis identifies pollution patterns, seasonal variations, and key pollutants contributing to poor air quality. The insights from this study can help policymakers and citizens understand the state of air pollution and its potential health impacts.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze AQI trends across major Indian cities (2015-2024)
- Identify seasonal patterns and peak pollution periods
- Examine relationships between different pollutants
- Validate data quality and monitoring consistency
- Compare regional air quality variations
- Provide data-driven insights for environmental awareness

- **Correlation Analysis** for multi-variable datasets

## 🔍 Key Features Analyzed

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Missing Values Handling** - Identified and treated null values
- **Data Type Conversion** - DateTime formatting for temporal analysis
- **Duplicate Removal** - Ensured data integrity
- **City Name Standardization** - Consistent naming conventions
- **Outlier Detection** - IQR method for statistical outliers
- **Feature Engineering** - Created Season, Month, AQI_Level columns

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- **Distribution Analysis** - Histograms and KDE plots for AQI and pollutants

- **Trend Analysis** - Line plots for yearly and seasonal patterns
- **Comparative Analysis** - Bar charts for city-wise and region-wise comparisons
- **Categorical Analysis** - Pie charts for AQI category distributions
- **Box & Violin Plots** - Outlier detection and distribution spread

## 🔬 Analytical Insights & Impact
- **Trend Identification** - Decade-long patterns and seasonal variations reveal persistent environmental challenges
- **Pollution Hotspots** - Geographic analysis shows uniform distribution across all regions
- **Health Impact Assessment** - 80% hazardous days indicate serious public health risks
- **Data Quality Validation** - Correlation inconsistencies highlight monitoring standardization needs
- **Policy Recommendations** - Data supports need for nationwide rather than city-specific strategies
- **Public Health Implications** - Chronic exposure requires urgent health advisory systems

 ## 📊 Key Findings
- **Nationwide Crisis**: All major cities show consistently high AQI levels (249-253)
- **No Decadal Improvement**: Air quality remains in "Very Poor" category throughout 2015-2024
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Peak pollution during winter and post-monsoon seasons
- **Health Emergency**: 80% of days in "Poor" to "Severe" categories
- **Uniform Challenge**: Minimal variation between cities and regions

## 💡 Insights for Policy
- **Need for coordinated national-level strategies**
- **Focus on particulate matter reduction** 
- **Enhanced monitoring and data quality assurance**
- **Public health advisory systems**
- **Sustainable urban planning interventions**

## ⚠️ Data Quality & Limitations
*Note: Initial correlation analysis revealed unexpected near-zero relationships between AQI and pollutants, suggesting potential data quality issues. This finding itself provides valuable insights into monitoring consistency challenges.*

**Key Finding:** The near-zero correlations highlight the need for standardized AQI calculation methodologies across monitoring stations.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates Python's effectiveness in environmental data analysis, revealing India's persistent air quality crisis from 2015-2024. The analysis shows consistently hazardous AQI levels across all major cities with no decade-long improvement, highlighting an urgent public health emergency where 80% of days fall in "Poor" to "Severe" categories.

While data quality considerations emerged, the clear patterns provide a data-driven foundation for policymakers to develop coordinated national strategies, improve monitoring systems, and implement effective pollution control measures for sustainable air quality management.
